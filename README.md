# Investigating the relation between R&D spending and primary energy from renewable sources

This code is written in the context of the lecture series "Data Literacy" at the University of TÃ¼bingen in WS21/22. Here is the abstract from the report:

The transition to an increase in use of energy from renewable sources has beenidentified as an effective strategy to achieve goals for the mitigation of climate change.
In this report, the relationship between public research and development(R&D) spending on renewable energy technology and primary energy from renew-able sources is
investigated for a collection of western, industrialized countries. Overall, the analysis in the present report cannot provide conclusive evidence onthe relationship
between the variables of interest, however, weak trends can be observed.
